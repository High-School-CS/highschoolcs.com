## Text Editors
Text editors are a great way to get started with programming.
They allow you to quickly write code and see the results. 
This is great if you just want to write a short script or two.

- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)


## Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
IDEs are used to develop software. They often provide a graphical user interface (GUI) and a command line interface (CLI).
By using one of these, you can develop software much more efficiently than using a text editor.

##### Python:
- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
- [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/)
- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)

###### Java:
- [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
- [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/)

## Version Control Systems (VCS)

Version control systems are used to keep track of changes to software. 
While they are not required to develop software, they are very useful.
You don't have to use them when you get started, but it's best to get familiar with them
as you will most definitely use them in the future.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Github](https://github.com/)
- [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)
- [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/)
